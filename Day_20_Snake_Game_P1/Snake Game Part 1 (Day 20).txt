Snake Game (Part 1) – Python Project
The first half of a classic Snake Game built in Python using the Turtle module. This version focuses on creating the snake body, refactoring to OOP, and implementing basic movement controls. Developed as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Features
Creates a multi-segment snake body using Turtle objects

Refactored into an OOP structure with a Snake class

Supports keyboard controls for up, down, left, and right directions

Smooth snake movement with screen updates and delays

Prevents invalid direction changes (e.g., no 180-degree turns)

How It Works
The screen is set up with a black background and title.

A Snake object is instantiated and its body is created from predefined coordinates.

Key bindings are set for arrow keys to control direction.

In a game loop, the snake moves forward: tail segments follow the head's previous positions.

Direction methods adjust the head's heading while avoiding reverse turns.

Getting Started
Ensure Python’s Turtle module is installed (usually default in Python).

Save main.py and snake.py in the same folder.

Run the script in a Python environment that supports GUI:

text
python main.py
Use arrow keys to control the snake; click to exit when done.

What I Practiced & Learned
Refactoring procedural code into OOP with classes and methods

Managing lists of Turtle objects for the snake body

Implementing movement logic and direction controls

Using screen listeners for keyboard input and game loops
