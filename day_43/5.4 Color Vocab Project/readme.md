Japanese Colors Website – CSS Basics Project
A beginner-friendly project to apply foundational CSS concepts such as inline, internal, and external stylesheets while creating a simple webpage showcasing colors in Japanese. This project reinforced learning about different CSS selectors and styling techniques for organizing web content effectively.

Features
Uses an external CSS file linked to the HTML document

Demonstrates CSS selectors: ID selectors (#red, #blue), class selectors (.color-title), and element selectors (img)

Applies colors to text corresponding to the color names in Japanese

Adjusts image sizes consistently using CSS

Builds a visual, well-structured webpage with semantic HTML

How It Works
HTML file contains headings and images associated with different colors

External CSS file styles text color, font weight, and image dimensions

Selectors like IDs and classes target specific elements for precise styling

Images use the alt attribute for accessibility and better SEO

Separation of HTML content and CSS presentation improves maintainability

Getting Started
Save index.html and style.css in the same project folder.

Include image assets in referenced folders as used in HTML.

Open index.html in any modern browser to view the styled page.

Modify CSS selectors and properties to practice styling changes.
