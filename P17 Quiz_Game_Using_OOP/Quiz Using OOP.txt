Quiz Game – Python Project
A command-line trivia quiz game built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It presents true/false questions from a dataset, tracks the player's score, and provides feedback on answers. Developed as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Features
Loads trivia questions from a data file

Uses OOP with classes for Questions and QuizBrain

Asks true/false questions one by one

Checks answers and updates score in real-time

Displays final score at the end of the quiz

Handles a fixed set of general knowledge questions

How It Works
Questions are loaded from data.py into a question bank using the Question class.

The QuizBrain class manages the quiz flow, presenting each question in sequence.

Player inputs "True" or "False" for each question.

The program checks the answer, provides feedback, and increments the score if correct.

Continues until all questions are answered, then displays the total score.

Getting Started
Ensure all files (question_model.py, data.py, quiz_brain.py, main.py) are in the same folder.

Run the script in your terminal:

text
python main.py
Answer the true/false questions as prompted!

What I Practiced & Learned
Creating classes, objects, attributes, and methods in OOP

Organizing code into modular files for better structure

Working with lists and dictionaries to manage trivia data

Implementing loops and conditionals for quiz logic
