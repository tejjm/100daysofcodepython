# Number Guessing Game – Python Project

A simple command-line Number Guessing Game built in Python as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

---

## Features

- User selects a difficulty: Easy (10 tries) or Hard (5 tries)
- Random number between 1 and 100 generated each game
- Interactive prompts guide the player with feedback ("Go higher", "Go lower")
- Tracks number of attempts left and announces win/loss

---

## How It Works

1. The program greets the user and picks a random number from 1 to 100.
2. Player chooses difficulty level (Easy/Hard) which sets number of tries.
3. Player has to guess the number within the allowed attempts:
    - Feedback is given if guess is too low or too high.
    - Game ends once the player guesses right or runs out of attempts.

## Getting Started

1. Save the script as `main.py`
2. Run in your terminal:

   python main.py

3. Follow the prompts to play and guess the number!
