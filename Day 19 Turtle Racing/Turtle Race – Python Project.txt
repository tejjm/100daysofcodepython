Turtle Race – Python Project

A fun command-line Turtle graphics simulation of a race between colored turtles. Users bet on which turtle will win, and the program randomly advances them until a winner is determined. Built as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Features
Creates multiple Turtle objects, each with a unique color

Allows user to bet on a winning color

Simulates race with random forward movements

Detects when a turtle crosses the finish line

Compares winner to user's bet and displays result

How It Works
Sets up a screen and positions 6 turtles of different colors at the starting line.

Prompts the user to bet on a color (e.g., "red", "blue").

Starts the race: Each turtle moves a random distance (1-10 units) in a loop.

The first turtle to reach x-coordinate > 220 wins.

Announces the winner and whether the user's bet was correct.

Getting Started
Ensure Python’s Turtle module is installed (usually default in Python).

Save the code as main.py.

Run the script in a Python environment that supports GUI:

text
python main.py
Enter your bet when prompted, watch the race, and click to exit when done.

What I Practiced & Learned
Creating and managing multiple object instances in OOP

Working with object states (e.g., positions, colors)

Using higher-order functions and loops for dynamic behavior

Integrating randomization for unpredictable outcomes
