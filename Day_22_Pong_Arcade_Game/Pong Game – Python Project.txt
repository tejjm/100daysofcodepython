Pong Game – Python Project

A classic Pong Game built in Python using the Turtle module with Object-Oriented Programming principles. Control paddles to keep the ball in play and race to score points against your opponent. Developed as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Features
OOP design with classes for Paddle, Ball, and Scoreboard

Two-player paddle controls with keyboard input (W/S for left paddle, Up/Down for right paddle)

Ball movement, bouncing off walls and paddles with increasing speed on paddle hits

Score tracking and display for both players

Ball reset when a player scores a point

How It Works
Sets up an 800x600 window with a black background.

Creates two paddle objects positioned on left and right sides.

Creates a ball object that moves continuously, bouncing off top/bottom and paddles.

Detects when the ball passes the left or right edge to award points and reset position.

Updates and displays player scores during the game.

Keyboard controls allow players to move their paddles vertically.

Getting Started
Ensure Python’s Turtle module is installed (usually default in Python).

Save the files (main.py, paddle.py, ball.py, scoreboard.py) in the same folder.

Run the script in a Python environment that supports GUI:

text
python main.py
Control paddles using:

Left paddle: 'W' (up) and 'S' (down)

Right paddle: Up and Down arrow keys

Play the Pong game until ready to exit (close the window).

What I Practiced & Learned
Created class hierarchies and used inheritance with Turtle class

Implemented smooth paddle and ball movement with object state

Detected collisions with walls and paddles

Incorporated dynamic speed increases for ball after paddle hits

Managed real-time score display with Turtle graphics

Set up keyboard event listeners for two-player controls
