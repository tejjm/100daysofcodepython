RPG Ranking Webpage – Intermediate HTML Project
A hands-on HTML project showcasing intermediate web development concepts like ordered lists, anchor tags, and image elements. The webpage ranks top RPG games, displaying each with titles, images, and external links. Built as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge to solidify list handling and basic website construction.

Features
Ordered lists (<ol> and <li>) for ranked items

Headings and structured text for clarity and hierarchy

Image elements (<img>) with alt text for accessibility and visuals

Anchor elements (<a>) for clickable external links

Clean, readable markup suitable for expansion and styling

How It Works
Renders a page title and top-ranking games as an ordered list.

Each list item includes a heading, corresponding game image, and relevant alt text.

Adds an anchor tag linking to the Steam store for quick access.

Code is organized for clarity and easy editing in one HTML file.

Getting Started
Copy code into an index.html file.

Open file in a web browser to view content and click the Steam link.

Experiment by editing list items, images, or links for deeper practice.

What I Practiced & Learned
Building semantic, organized websites with intermediate HTML elements

Using ordered lists and headings for structure

Adding images with appropriate alt attributes for accessibility
