Snake Game with High Score and Mail Merge – Python Project
Two projects worked on Day 24 as part of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Snake Game with High Score
An improved classic Snake Game built in Python using the Turtle graphics module, with added functionality to save the high score locally and update it when the player beats it.

Features
Classic Snake gameplay using OOP

Includes food that the snake eats to grow

Detects collisions with walls and the snake’s own tail

Keeps track of current score and high score saved in a data.txt file

Resets the game when the snake hits a wall or itself, preserving the high score

How It Works
The snake moves using arrow keys, growing as it eats food.

The scoreboard displays current and high scores, updating the high score in a file when beaten.

The game resets snake position and score upon collisions.

Running
Run main.py with all code files present.

Ensure data.txt exists in the same folder for high score persistence (empty or "0" initially).

Use arrow keys to control the snake.

Mail Merge Text File Project
A mini-project to practice file handling in Python (opening, reading, writing, and paths).

Reads a list of names from a text file

Reads a starting letter template containing a placeholder [name]

For each name, creates a personalized letter replacing the placeholder

Saves each letter as a separate file in an output folder

What I Practiced & Learned
Reading/writing files and working with absolute and relative paths

Implementing file I/O in a practical use case (mail merge)

Using class inheritance and method organization in Python

Persisting game data across sessions with local file storage

Organizing multiple Python files in a single project
