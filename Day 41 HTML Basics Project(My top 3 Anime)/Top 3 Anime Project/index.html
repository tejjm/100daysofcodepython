 <h1>The Best Anime Uttej Watched in 2025</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 Anime at the moment</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>One Piece 👒💀</h3>
 <p>Everyone says pacing is an issue which it is but in terms of story, what it covers, what emotions it brings out,
and the depth this goes into my top 2 and mostly stays at #1. Wano was Aamzing and Egghead is cooking. Thank you Oda sensei!
 </p>
 <h3>Attack on Titan ⚔️🔰</h3>
 <p>Having a protagonist whom you love to watching him perform things which makes you conflicted so much and 
    the ending to top it all off. Thank you Hajime Isayama!
 </p>
 <h3>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End 🧝‍♀️🪄</h3>
 <p>Each episode heals you a little no matter what you're going through, such unique concept atleast for what I watched. 
    Hope season 2 comes out in a good shape as season 1.
