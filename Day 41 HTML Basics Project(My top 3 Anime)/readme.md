HTML Anime Ranking Webpage – Project
A beginner HTML project to practice and demonstrate foundational elements like headings, paragraphs, line breaks, and horizontal rules. The webpage lists and reviews top anime watched in 2025, applying semantic markup for clear structure and readability. Part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Features
Uses HTML heading tags for page structure

Adds paragraphs for content and reviews

Inserts line breaks and horizontal rules for clarity

Customized sections for each anime with emojis for fun visual flair

Clean, readable code ready for extension with more HTML features

How It Works
Sets up document structure with <h1> and <h2> for page title and section header

Uses <hr/> for horizontal rule separation

Creates <h3> subheadings for each anime review

Writes multi-line <p> tags to share thoughts and highlights on each show

Keeps everything within a single HTML file for simplicity

Getting Started
Save HTML code to a file (e.g., index.html)

Open in a web browser to see the rendered webpage

Explore by editing text, changing emojis, and adding more elements to practice HTML
