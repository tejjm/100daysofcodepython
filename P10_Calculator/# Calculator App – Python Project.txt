# Calculator App – Python Project

A simple command-line calculator built in Python, developed as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

---

## Features

- Supports basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Uses **functions** for clean and reusable code (inputs and outputs handled)
- Implements a **dictionary** to map operators to functions
- Includes **while loops** for repeated calculations
- Uses **conditionals** for user choices and error handling

---

## How It Works

1. Program prompts user for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
2. Uses a dictionary to call the correct operation function.
3. Displays the result and asks if the user wants to continue.
4. Allows chaining calculations with previous results or exits as per user choice.

## Getting Started

1. Save the project as `main.py`
2. Run in your terminal:

   python main.py

3. Follow the prompts to perform calculations.

## What I Practiced

- Functions with arguments and return values
- Dictionaries mapping operators to functions
- Input validation and control flow with while/if
