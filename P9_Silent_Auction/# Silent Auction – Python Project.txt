# Silent Auction – Python Project

A simple command-line Silent Auction program built in Python. Users enter their bids in secret, and the highest bidder wins! Developed as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Features

- Accepts multiple bids using user prompts.
- Bidders and their corresponding bids are stored securely in a Python dictionary.
- Utilizes while loops for continuous bidding sessions until bidding ends.
- Automatically determines and announces the highest bidder.
- Clean and easy-to-read code with comments for learning purposes.

## How It Works

1. The program asks each user for their name and bid amount.
2. Each bid is added to a dictionary ({name: bid}).
3. Users are prompted if there are more bidders—if not, bidding ends.
4. At the end, the program scans all bids to find and display the winner and their bid.

## Getting Started

1. Run the script in your terminal:

   python main.py

2. Follow the prompts to input names and bid amounts.
3. When no bidders remain, the winner and highest bid will be displayed.

## What I Practiced & Learned

- Using dictionaries to store and retrieve user data.
- Constructing input loops with while and for.
- Implementing conditional logic to control program flow.
